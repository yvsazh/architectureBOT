This dataset contains approximately 5000 images from 25 architectural styles. The raw images are downloaded from Wikimedia Commons ("http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Architecture_by_style"), with the first 5000 images from each style. We manually filtered the images to exclude images of interior decoration, building parts, or severe scale and orientation change, and resulted in a total of 5000 images. 

For reference, the time period and style relationships between styles checked with Wikipedia are provided in the txt files.

Some of the images are collected from the 4-class dataset, reported in the paper "Visual pattern discovery for architecture image classiÔ¨Åcation and product image search".
